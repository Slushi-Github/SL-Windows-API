# SL WINDOWS API

This library, actually called “Slushi Windows API”, is a library for Haxe, with a lot of Windows API functions, to use it in your Haxe projects.

This is a simplified version of the Windows API that I have in my [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) Engine, [Slushi Engine](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/Slushi-Engine).
